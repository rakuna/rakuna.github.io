title: Book review - hobonichi techo cousin avec
---

So I recently ordered my latest annual diary from hobonichi.

And there's something about it that really appeals to me.


Paper:
Very nice, thin, strong, smooth writing surface

Layout:
A5, but with enough space for a weekly schedule view
Also couples with a day to a page view and month to a page view (did I mention that the paper is very thin)

Style:
Bright vibrant colours with a variety of internal pockets for storing loose sheets.
