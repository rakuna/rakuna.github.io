As part of installing Homebrew a few errors came up when running:
brew doctor

# Post install tidy-up
==> Next steps:
- Run these two commands in your terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH:
    echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/tom/.zprofile
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
- Run brew help to get started
- Further documentation:
    https://docs.brew.sh

# Error when intalling Ruby
>>> Regenerating ./configure script ...
autoreconf: error: 'configure.ac' is required
!!! Configuration of ruby 3.1.2 failed!

# Error when running brew doctor

Please note that these warnings are just used to help the Homebrew maintainers
with debugging if you file an issue. If everything you use Homebrew for is
working fine: please don't worry or file an issue; just ignore this. Thanks!
