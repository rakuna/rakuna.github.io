I've been thinking about the direction to take this blog for a little while now, and am looking to deviate from a self-commentary on setting up a blog on the various platforms I've tried so far (Ghost / Jekyll).

Instead I'm experimenting with a new concept, which I'm calling, things I enjoy.
More specifically, stationery.

For those that know me they'd say I'm organised, and that I have a particular style to how I note things.
Whether this is with fountain pens, or an everyday carry paper and pen notebook, or a diary in Japanese.
It's simply my curation of things, things I enjoy.

To kick-off this series, I'm going to start with something that I carry (almost) everyday, my field notes capture tool, or as I refer to it Muninn.
[Muninn][huginn-muninn] (after one of Odin's ravens in mythology, the other raven being [Huginn][huginn-muninn] or my iPhone).

What I call [Muninn][field-notes-muninn] came about as a collaboration between [Field Notes][field-notes], and [Bellroy][bellroy].
Originally it came with a few [Field Notes][field-notes] notebooks, but I've since used those up and am now working my way through a small stockpile of Field Notes notebooks.
With the latest, in use, notebooks being [TRAILHEAD][field-notes-trailhead] (or FNC-51: SUMMER 2021) one of a limited 30,000 pack edition.
