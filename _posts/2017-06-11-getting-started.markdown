So I've decided to take the plunge into the world of blogging and website hosting.

My initial motivation to venture into this world is to have a nice format to publish reviews of books I read. My secondary motivation being to learn the details associated with setting up and hosting websites.

An initial search of website options led me to [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) as the best option for a self-hosted website, and a fee other options for non-self-hosted websites (e.g. [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/), [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/), [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/)). Seeing the benefit in learning the nuts and bolts that sit behind the website, I decided to go down the, self-hosted, WordPress path.

Next I needed to figure out where to host my WordPress site. From past participation in some hackathons ([Unearthed MineHack](https://www.unearthed.solutions/hackathons/unearthed-minehack-perth-2016/) and [Unearthed Perth 2017](https://www.unearthed.solutions/hackathons/unearthed-perth-2017/)) I received some [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) credits and wanted to figure out what they could do for me.

Having decided to host a WordPress site on AWS, I then needed to figure out how I would get everything setup and working. AWS has a nice tutorial to get things rolling using Bitnami which is quick and easy to setup. However as I want to understand the back-end I opted for a do-it-yourself (DIY) setup. This consists of a LAMP stack ( **L** inux (Ubuntu in particular), **A** pache (web-server), **M** ySQL (database), **P** HP (server-side scripting)) with WordPress running on top.
