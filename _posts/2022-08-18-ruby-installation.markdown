Now that [Homebrew][homebrew] is installed we need to get [Ruby][ruby] installed.

The [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/#step-1-install-homebrew) recommends doing this with a version manager (which allows multiple different versions of Ruby to be installed at the same time).
The version manager recommended is [chruby][chruby].

The installation of Ruby was then done by following this [guide](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/#how-to-install-different-versions-of-ruby-and-switch-between-them).
