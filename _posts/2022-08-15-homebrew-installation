This blog is hosted on [GitHub Pages][github-pages], which uses [Jekyll][jekyll]. [Here's a quick video on what that means][https://youtu.be/2MsN8gpT6jY].

To get the blog up and running, and enable local viewing, we need to install [Jekyll][jekyll] "Transform your plain text into static websites and blogs", which is written in Ruby[ruby] "A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write".

The [Jekyll documentation][https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/#step-1-install-homebrew] recommends installing Ruby via Homebrew, instead of [using the system Ruby][system-ruby].

Installing [Homebrew][homebrew] is "The Missing Package Manager for macOS", is done via a single command.
```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
