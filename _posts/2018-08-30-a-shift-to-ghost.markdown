So it's been a while since I've done any blogging...  
I have also recently come across [ghost](ghost.org), which brands itself as:

> "...a proud non-profit organisation building open source technology for journalism "

This concept aligns to my own personal values by being simple and focused. It also matches nicely with what I'm trying to achieve with this blog, which is to write blog posts.

The icing on the cake is a dedicated android-based editing and publishing app that enables blog post writing on the go.

Given all this, I thought I'd dust off my server setup and blogging skills, and give this a shot.
