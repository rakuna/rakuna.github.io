# Whisky reviews

I've been enjoying whisky lately and thought I'd try my hand at describing the flavours of a whisky in a classic review format.

My intent being to:

- Describe a whisky in a way that reflects its taste
  - Using as little jargon as possible
- Build my whisky flavour vocabulary
- Build my own ability to notice the subleties of a whisky.

# Review approach

My initial approach is to use a simplified version of Jim Murray's Approach ( **Nose** , **Taste** , **Finish** , and **Balance** ) as detailed in his [Whisky Bible](http://whiskybible.com/). My approach being to only consided **Nose** , **Taste** , and **Finish** , with the intent being to incorporate **Balance** over time and in subsequent reviews.

# Oban 14

_ **Nose** _  
Whisky malt with slight sweetness and floral notes

_ **Taste** _  
Rich smooth malt flavour with some slight wood notes.

_ **Finish** _  
Smooth lingering mouthfeel, with mild peppery feel.

_ **Summary** _  
A strong smooth classic whisky taste.
